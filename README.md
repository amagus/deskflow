**Deskflow** is a free and open source keyboard and mouse sharing app.
Use the keyboard, mouse, or trackpad of one computer to control nearby computers,
and work seamlessly between them.
It's like a software KVM (but without the video).

## Fork

This fork hardcodes several of my settings and is meant to be for personal use only.
Feel free to grab my changes if you think this could help you.
I unfortunately have no time to transform my changes in settings to be added to main deskflow project.
